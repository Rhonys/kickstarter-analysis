# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analyzing Kickstarter data to understand trends of successful and failed campaigns, and recommending attributes of successful campaigns using visualizations and descriptive statistics
Client - Louise is seeking to start a Kickstarter campaign for a play in London and wants to know what she needs to do to be successful. Based on my analysis, conducting a Kickstarter campaign in Theater gives you the highest chance of success.![Picture1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95246572/146454573-2421b169-951e-4198-88b3-3248564e9e64.png)
 and a campaign for a play also has the highest evidence of success. ![Picture3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95246572/146454589-3854f9c1-0c7c-4c81-a020-fcf1142fc87b.png)
It is also recommended to conduct your campaign in either May or June ![Picture2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95246572/146454601-5f82e488-d86e-4f7d-afe4-af0455c7bf93.png)
and have it last for 30-60 days. The average goal of successful campaigns are $5000 or less, with most campaigns increasing in failure rate up until $8000 where anything above generally fails. The average pledge is $5602, with the bottom 25th percentile being $1717. The average donation of a successful campaign is $93 while bottom 25th percentile beign $52. The average number of backers is 63, with the lowest 25th percentile being 23. 
If the campaigns goals remain with these parameters, it has the highest chance of being successful.
