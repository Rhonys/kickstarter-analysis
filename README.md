Client - Louise is seeking to start a Kickstarter campaign for a play in London and wants to know what she needs to do to be successful. Based on my analysis, conducting a Kickstarter campaign in Theater gives you the highest chance of success. ![Categories](C:\Users\Nathan\Documents\Bootcamp\Excel Coursework.Picture1.png) and a campaign for a play also has the highest evidence of success. ![Categories](C:\Users\Nathan\Documents\Bootcamp\Excel Coursework.Picture3.png) It is also recommended to conduct your campaign in either May or June ![Categories](C:\Users\Nathan\Documents\Bootcamp\Excel Coursework.Picture2.png) and have it last for 30-60 days. The average goal of successful campaigns are $5000 or less, with most campaigns increasing in failure rate up until $8000 where anything above generally fails. The average pledge is $5602, with the bottom 25th percentile being $1717. The average donation of a successful campaign is $93 while bottom 25th percentile beign $52. The average number of backers is 63, with the lowest 25th percentile being 23.
